# Welcome Travellers

We are Zen & Sa, experienced tour guides from one of Northern Vietnam’s indigenous tribes – Black Hmong, which is at the foothills of the Dragon Mountains. We have been guides in Northern Vietnam for many years, educating tourists with our local tribal knowledge of our culture and our lands. Come with us and really experience Northern Vietnam.

We offer private trekking and cultural tours of the spectacular Muong Hoa valley in Sapa, the ancient and spiritual capital of Vietnam with the largest temples – Ninh Binh and mountainous Ha Giang province with its gigantic karst rock forests in the Global Geological Park and then there are the tours of the vibrant markets where many tribes people go to trade. If there are specific things you want to see, stay at different locations or have a trek with lower KM’s, we can tailor the trip to your needs. 

We both speak fluent English, so feel free to message us or give us a call. We cant wait to see you. Don’t forget to like us on Facebook,  Instagram, TripAdvisor as there are also many exciting events throughout the year so check the calendars on the destination pages for what’s on. By booking with us, you are directly supporting 2 women, our families and the local people who’s homestay’s we visit. Eco tourism gives us an opportunity to better our lives so thank you in advance.

Kindest regards, Zen & Sa

# Trekking In Northern Vietnam

Northern Vietnam is still relatively wild and attracts the adventurer wishing to see spectacular landscapes, native peoples and traditional ways of life (we only got electricity 20 years ago in the villages and it was quite the event I can tell you!).

Trekking in Northern Vietnam is an amazing experience. A private tour is the perfect way to see Northern Vietnam with a small group of friends.  This is by far the most popular type of visitor we have. We do also cater for families, couples and solo travellers too, we love all our guests equally!

A trekking guide is essential in Northern Vietnam. From showing the way on the trails to organising the homestay accommodation, entrance to tribal lands, introducing indigenous tribes and explaining what is going on, visiting various workshops and translating to English (some villages are still populated by 100% tribal people who speak Hmong / Vietnamese only).

A general level of fitness is required to really get the best out of the trekking adventures. Treks are usually 5-7 hours of walking per day. If you feel that is a bit much, please contact us and we will recommend or change a tour for you to meet your requirements. Remember these are private tours so we can tailor to your needs. You will also need some comfortable footware that is suitable for trekking. You can buy trekking shoes in Vietnam if you are “travelling light” but beware that shoes bigger than size 42 for men and 38 for women are not commonly stocked.

# Destinations

## Ha Giang

Right now this is the hot destination for the adventurer. Your tour comes with English speaking tour guide (thats me – Zen). There are amazing waterfalls at Ban Gioc to see, rice terraces, native tribes that we will introduce you to, the limestone karst forests, the caves at Lung Khuy, Na Luong, Kho My and Phuong Thien. As well as sights such as the Hmong King Palace. Depending on your timetable it is also possible to incorporate market visits to your tour. Tours of Ha Giang range from 3 to 5 days. The 5 day tour is the most popular as the remoteness of the region lends itself to that. To read more about the tours of Ha Giang and to book <click here>

## Sapa

People choose Sapa for a number of reasons. It’s slightly more developed as a destination, has more established trails and more comfortable amenities. There are also the mountains to see as well as the specular landscapes with the Muong Hoa valley, rivers, rice terraces, bamboo forests, workshops for cooking and batik textile making. It is also possible to go visit a big market in the north from Sapa but the distance means an early start and a fair drive (2hrs each way). Getting to Sapa is also very easy. Equally popular is the sleeper bus and the overnight train.

We offer a number of tours in Sapa ranging from 1 to 4 days and with more hiking or less hiking as is your preference. The 2-3 day tours are the most popular. Tours are run by myself Zen or my sister Sa. To read more about the tours of Sapa and to book <click here>

## Ninh Binh

It’s the ancient and spiritual capital of Vietnam. Ninh Binh is the southmost part of Northern Vietnam and close to Hanoi. Accessible by both train and car in about 2 hours. To get the best out of the trip, we created a 2 day tour. This means you can take a more leisurely pace than if it were just a 1 day tour with planed activities, treks, great local food and an overnight stay with a tribal family.

# Choosing your tour destination

So which destination is best for you? Treks in Ha Giang are easier than Sapa’s mountainous terrain with a driver taking you to a new destination each day. Ha Giang is more remote and harder to get to. This isolation means that it is less touristy, more rural and traditional. With its limestone karst forests and newly discovered caves, river boat trip’s, waterfall’s and Hmong King Palace among other things there is quite a lot to entice to you come and see Ha Giang. 

Sapa by comparison is more developed as a destination for trekkers, has better facilities and a more rugged and mountainous terrain (Fansipan peak is over 3km high!) as well as the bamboo forests and various workshops to engage with. We carry what we need and we trek from village to village with only motorised transport to take us back to Sapa at the end. For many, this makes it feel more like an adventure.

Where does that leave Ninh Binh? Ninh Binh has the advantage of being closer to Hanoi. It’s only 2 hours away and is sometimes called the land locked Halong Bay with its limestone karst’s that line the sides of the river. Trips to Ninh Binh are especially popular with people living in Hanoi who want to get out of the big city and have a nature and cultural experience. It’s also a great weekend break.
