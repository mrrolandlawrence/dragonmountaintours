# Trekking In Nothern Vietnam - What You Need To Know

Northern Vietnam is still relatively wild and attracts the adventurer wishing to see spectacular landscapes, native peoples and traditional ways of life (we only got electricity 20 years ago in the villages and it was quite the event I can tell you!).

Trekking in Northern Vietnam is an amazing experience. A private tour is the perfect way to see Northern Vietnam with a small group of friends.  This is by far the most popular type of visitor we have. We do also cater for families, couples and solo travellers too, we love all our guests equally! 

A trekking guide is essential in Northern Vietnam. From showing the way on the trails to organising the homestay accommodation, entrance to tribal lands, introducing indigenous tribes and explaining what is going on, visiting various workshops and translating to English (some villages are still populated by 100% tribal people who speak Hmong / Vietnamese only).

## Covid

Vietnam has taken strict and swift precautions to protect against the covid pandemic. This means for the time being, tavelling to Vietnam is very difficult at the moment with only a few exceptions given. There are tour companies taking bookings now, but there is no guarantee that these tours will go ahead as many safety criteria have to be satasfied fist on a national level. However if you are already here and are feeling some wanderlust then there is no issue. 

## Weather - Monthly Averages For Northern Vietnam

Peak season is between May and November. Many people have this time off to come and visit as well as the sunlight / dry days being optimal. Below is a chart with the monthy average for Northern Vietnam (source Wikipedia 2018). Ga Hiang, Sapa and Ninh Binh.

## Fitness And Health - Getting The Most From Your Adventure

A general level of fitness is required to really get the best out of the trekking adventures. Treks are usually 5-7 hours of walking per day. We rate each of the tours and tell you how many KM walking per day is on the itinery. Please note that with a private tour, so you can do as much or as little as you are comfortable and happy with.

As far as vaccinations go. Vietnam is a pretty safe place. Dengi is worth a mention, though it is not common with toursits as they tend to drink bottled water and eat higher quality food than the locals.

## What To Bring

We recommend you to have some comfortable footware that is suitable for trekking. You can buy trekking shoes in Vietnam if you are “travelling light” but beware that shoes bigger than size 42 for men and 38 for women are not commonly stocked. Other items to take would be sunblock for the summer months, mosquito repellant and suitable clothing for the time of year that you book. Please check the tour details as you will find the intformation for the average monthly temperatures, hours of sunshine and rainfall there to help you plan your adventure.

For multi day tours, accomodation is provided in either a hotel or homestay depending on trip / options. Eating is with chopsticks though a spoon is avaliable on request if you require. 

## Getting To Sapa, Ha Giang & Ninh Binh

Tours to Ha Giang start from Hanoi, being driven in a private car with a driver who knows the area well. Beautiful mountain passes are not to be undertaken by the inexperianced. They are wild and rugged (read: basic). 

Tours in Sapa are from Sapa. If you require assistance getting there from Hanoi, select from the additional options when you subit your enquiry. Options are going by overnight train (most popular) and also luxury coach which is very reasonably priced. Otherwise we will collect you from a central location, either your hotel or by the church in the main square as this is such an iconic landmark.

To get to Ninh Binh, it's either private car or train. If you are wishing to go by train it usually means an early start as the only morning trains are at 6am and 9am respectively.

Visiting Vietnam is a great and wonderful experiance. For most travellers the visa is free and is for up to 15 days. You can also get an e-visa that is up to 1 month. Please check <here> to find out rules and regulations for your country.
