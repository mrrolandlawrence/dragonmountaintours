# Ha Giang

Right now this is the hot destination for the adventurer. Your tour comes with English speaking tour guide (thats me – Zen). There are amazing waterfalls at Ban Gioc to see, rice terraces, native tribes that we will introduce you to, the limestone karst forests, the caves at Lung Khuy, Na Luong, Kho My and Phuong Thien. As well as sights such as the Hmong King Palace. Depending on your timetable it is also possible to incorporate market visits to your tour. Tours of Ha Giang range from 3 to 5 days. The 5 day tour is the most popular as the remoteness of the region lends itself to that. To read more about the tours of Ha Giang and to book <click here>

tea growing > After crossing the border into Ha Giang province, we came upon a second beautiful tea plantation in Bac Quang district.

Our next stop was Quan Ba, known as “Heaven’s Gate”. 

We climbed a steep and bendy road to the Yen Minh pass, and stopped several times to snap photos of the stunning rice terraces that unfolded below, before passing through the town within the valley.
