# Destinations

## Ha Giang

Right now this is the hot destination for the adventurer. Your tour comes with English speaking tour guide (thats me – Zen). There are amazing waterfalls at Ban Gioc to see, rice terraces, native tribes that we will introduce you to, the limestone karst forests, the caves at Lung Khuy, Na Luong, Kho My and Phuong Thien. As well as sights such as the Hmong King Palace. Depending on your timetable it is also possible to incorporate market visits to your tour. Tours of Ha Giang range from 3 to 5 days. The 5 day tour is the most popular as the remoteness of the region lends itself to that. To read more about the tours of Ha Giang and to book <click here>

## Sapa

People choose Sapa for a number of reasons. It’s slightly more developed as a destination, has more established trails and more comfortable amenities. There are also the mountains to see as well as the specular landscapes with the Muong Hoa valley, rivers, rice terraces, bamboo forests, workshops for cooking and batik textile making. It is also possible to go visit a big market in the north from Sapa but the distance means an early start and a fair drive (2hrs each way). Getting to Sapa is also very easy. Equally popular is the sleeper bus and the overnight train.

We offer a number of tours in Sapa ranging from 1 to 4 days and with more hiking or less hiking as is your preference. The 2-3 day tours are the most popular. Tours are run by myself Zen or my sister Sa. To read more about the tours of Sapa and to book <click here>

## Ninh Binh

It’s the ancient and spiritual capital of Vietnam. Ninh Binh is the southmost part of Northern Vietnam and close to Hanoi. Accessible by both train and car in about 2 hours. To get the best out of the trip, we created a 2 day tour. This means you can take a more leisurely pace than if it were just a 1 day tour with planed activities, treks, great local food and an overnight stay with a tribal family.
