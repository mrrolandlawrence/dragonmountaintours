# Ninh Binh

Itâ€™s the ancient and spiritual capital of Vietnam. 



To get the best out of the trip, we created a 2 day tour. This means you can take a more leisurely pace than if it were just a 1 day tour with planed activities, treks, great local food and an overnight stay with a tribal family.

## Getting There

Ninh Binh is the southmost part of Northern Vietnam and 90km from Hanoi. There are 3 ways to access Ninh Binh, by train, by luxury bus and by private car. Journey time is 2-3 hours depnding on traffic. 

### By Train

There are 5-6 trains a day from Hanoi to Ninh Binh, mostly early in the morning and then a few in the evening. Ask for a cushioned seat when booking. You can also book your train ticket online. Many like the romance of the train and Vietnam's metre guage railway network certianly offers that. Food, drinks & toielt are also avaliable on the train.

### By Car

Private taxi's will take you all the way from Hanoi to Ninh Binh. A popular means of transport when there is a group that can fit in one car / minivan. We only use reptuble taxi companies. The other main attraction of the taxi is the flexability of the pickup times.

### By Luxury Bus

Bus travel is popular in Vietnam. There are luxury bus services from Hanoi. These tend to be smaller than full size bus / coach and with less but far more comfortable seating as well as air conditioning. WiFi is often avaliable on the bus too. Leg room in teh luxury bus is capacious.
