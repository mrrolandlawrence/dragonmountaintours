# Ninh Binh

Itâ€™s the ancient and spiritual capital of Vietnam. Ninh Binh is the southmost part of Northern Vietnam and close to Hanoi. Accessible by both train and car in about 2 hours. To get the best out of the trip, we created a 2 day tour. This means you can take a more leisurely pace than if it were just a 1 day tour with planed activities, treks, great local food and an overnight stay with a tribal family.
