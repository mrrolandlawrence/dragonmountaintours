# Sapa

People choose Sapa for a number of reasons. Itâ€™s slightly more developed as a destination, has more established trails and more comfortable amenities. There are also the mountains to see as well as the specular landscapes with the Muong Hoa valley, rivers, rice terraces, bamboo forests, workshops for cooking and batik textile making. It is also possible to go visit a big market in the north from Sapa but the distance means an early start and a fair drive (2hrs each way). Getting to Sapa is also very easy. Equally popular is the sleeper bus and the overnight train.

We offer a number of tours in Sapa ranging from 1 to 4 days and with more hiking or less hiking as is your preference. The 2-3 day tours are the most popular. Tours are run by myself Zen or my sister Sa. To read more about the tours of Sapa and to book <click here>
