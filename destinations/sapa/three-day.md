Our next destination is the small waterfalls at Giang Ta Chai via a larger bamboo forest. This 1:30hr hike will pass some breath taking scenery with rice terraces and the river Hoa for you to enjoy.

If you are going back to Hanoi we can drop you off at the bus station. if you are coming to Sapa from Hanoi, why not upgrade yourself from the sleeper style bus to a more luxurious European style coach with larger reclining seats? The cost with our provider is not much different to the sleeper bus.
