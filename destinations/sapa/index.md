# Sapa

People choose Sapa for a number of reasons. It’s slightly more developed as a destination, has more established trails and more comfortable amenities. There are also the mountains to see as well as the specular landscapes with the Muong Hoa valley, rivers, rice terraces, bamboo forests, workshops for cooking and batik textile making. It is also possible to go visit a big market in the north from Sapa but the distance means an early start and a fair drive (2hrs each way). Getting to Sapa is also very easy. Equally popular is the sleeper bus and the overnight train.

We offer a number of tours in Sapa ranging from 1 to 4 days and with more hiking or less hiking as is your preference. The 2-3 day tours are the most popular. Tours are run by myself Zen or my sister Sa. To read more about the tours of Sapa and to book <click here>

### History & Geography

 **Sapa** is also known as **Sa Pả** is part of the **Lào Cai region** - one of most northwest regions of Vietnam. The area has been settled by the **Hmong**, **Dao (Yao)**, **Giáy**, **Pho Lu**, and **Tày** starting from the 15th century. Sapa is famous for both its fine, rugged scenery and also its rich cultural diversity. These settlers built the **rice terraces** that you see today surrounding Sapa.
 
 Known in Vietnamese as the **Hoang Lien Son mountain range**, Sapa sits at some 1500m above sea level - making for more pleasant and cooler temperatures in the summer months. It has been a popular destination with French colonials escaping the summer heat of Hanoi and now popular with tourists wishing to see the **tribal lifestyles** of the indiginious population. The highest peak of the mountain range in Vietnam is **Fansipan** at over 3km high! Hoang Lien Son mountain range is also known in English as **Dragon Mountain**.
 
Trekking in Sapa is dominated by the Muong Hoa Valley which extends around the basin of the mountain range. The villages on the steps of the rice terraces make for some beautiful trekking and adventure. Access to these remote villages so far has ensured a traditional feel to the landscape that people come from far and wide to see. 

 There is a railway from Hanoi (station access via Le Duan Street) but it stops at Lào Cai as the steep incline made building any further too expensive. This is why the train station for Sapa is some 30km away! Going by train is still a very popular way to get to Sapa from Hanoi. There are **3 trains per day** and the journey takes around **8 hours**. The overnight train is the "express" which only stops at major stations. The day time service is the "all stations" type. The overnight service is the most popular with travellers, arriving in Sapa at 6am - ready for a day of adventure!
 
 With approximately 7000 people living in Sapa with a further 36,000 in the surrounding areas, population density is very low. Villages are numerious but not heavily populated as many of them are located on or next to the rice terraces themselves as the occupants are farmers.
