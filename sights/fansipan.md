# The Tallest Peak in Vietnam.

 It is the tallest mountain peak of Vietnam, Laos & Cambodia at 3,147.3 metres. It also goes by the nickname of "the Roof of Indochina". Fansipan is part of the Hoang Lien Son (Dragon) mountain range. Located in the Lao Cai province, Sapa is the nearest town, 9km away. 

 Climbing the mountain takes 3 days however there is a much easier option today - namely taking a scenic cable car which has been running since 2016! The cable car takes 20 minutes to travel the 6.3km to the top (a Guinness World Record for the longest non-stop three-rope cable car). It is worth noting that once at the top of the cable car station, there is another funicular railway to take you to the top of the mountain. You can take the steps instead, but there are hundreds of them and it takes a while even for the fittest.

 Fansipan is a popular tourist destination for both Vietnamese as well as foreign tourists. Going early in the day is advised to avoid the crowds. Checking the weather forcast is also a must as when it's foggy you really cant see much at the top. Being so high up, it's also a bit cooler (10c less than Sapa), so dress appropriately. If you are taking a tour in Sapa, this is well worth adding to your itinery.
