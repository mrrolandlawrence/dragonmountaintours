Ma Pi Leng means a bridge of a horse's nose, describing the shape of its shape. Has long been ranked by locals, Ma Pi Leng Pass is among the top 4 passes in Vietnam which are both beautiful and dangerous. Riding on this pass, you'll be amazed by the immense scenery of limestone mountains running to the horizon. You can see mountains under your feet, see local villages with their life far from your seat. Rock mountains in the right hands become cold at high places and this is difficult to ride with rainy weather.

Riding motorbike on Ma Pi Leng Pass will bring you exhilaration, that’s how beautiful the pass is. However, we only recommend those who have enough riding experience to take on the challenge because the road leading up Ma Pi Leng is no joke. It’s winding, narrow and two-way.

Tu San Canyon 

The fullest beauty of Tu San Canyon can only be appreciated from Ma Pi Leng Pass from where you can see the full view of the green poetic Nho Que River running through the deepest chasm in not only Dong Van geopark but also in Vietnam and even Southeast Asia. The scenery is dramatic, abstract and just so beautiful, especially under the sunlight.
