# Ban Goic Waterfalls 

One of Vietnamâ€™s most impressive natural sights situated along the Quay Son River. Located in the northeastern province of Cao Bang on the border with China the falls are 90km east of Cao Bang City. The falls are 30 metres high and 300 metres wide, making them the biggest (by width) waterfalls in Vietnam. 

Visitors can take a ride on a bamboo raft around the base of the falls for better views of the cascade, however getting up close - expect to get a little wet! The raft journey usually lasts for around 10 minutes. There are also signs for no swimming in the blue water pools to the side of the falls, but these notices are rarely enforced. 

Getting there is now easier than ever, but they are still to be considered fairly remote. Because of this, they are not so crowded and perfect for someone who wants to explore or have an uncrowded getaway. 

Nguom Ngao caves are nearby and well worth a visit if you come here. They are well lit, but missing western health and safety protcols like handrails.
