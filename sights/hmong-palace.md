# Hmong King's Palace

Located in the Sa Phin Valley 1600 meters height above sea level is the palace of Vuong Duc Chinh and his son Vuong Chi Sinh. Vuong Duc Chinh was a mandarin under Nguyen Dynasty. During the Nguyen dynasty, King Khai Dinh in 1913 issued a royal proclaimation appointing Duc as the sole rule of the frontier region. He proclaimed himself as the King of the region, and adopted the title “Vua Meo”, meaning “King of the Meo” (former name of the Mong ethnic group) to dominate all the northern mountainous region. Vuong Chinh Duc became rich from dealing goods, especially opium. Sa Phin is the middle point of opium from the Golden Triangle region of Myanmar Yunnan China to Indochina. Duc also set up his own army unit of loyal Hmong people.

The Palace, also known Vua Meo (King of the Hmong), was built in 1902 in accordance with Feng Shui rules at a cost of 150,000 peices of silver. The location was chosen because the terrain resembles a turtle shell, which represents long life and wealth. Located on a mountain with a tortoise’s back shape, this house was expected to bring wealth and prosperity to the owner because the turtle is one of the four sacred animals in the traditional Vietnamese legend (the four being the Dragon, Unicorn, Turtle and Phoenix). The design is influenced by the traditional architecture of the Qing dynasty in China in the late 1890s as well as elements of the local Mong culture. The palace took 10 years to complete, is a two-story structure with 64 rooms and has floorspace of 1,120 square meters. Iron, wood, green stone and yin-and-yang terracotta tiles were used in the construction of the palace. Wealth and the families power are represented with images of dragon's, phoenix's and bat's carved on pillars throughout. The Chinese Han character “shou” meaning longevity also can be seen in every roof tile. There is also a food store, an underground room to keep opium, weapons and materials for living. Also a semicircular swimming bath was chiseled from a giant block of stone which was for the King to have his bath with goat milk. Stories of the great wealth of the Vuong family, say that the walls have gold inside them.

There is a local market called Sa Phin Market in front of the palace gate run by mostly Hmong people some who are considered the direct descendants of the Vuong family. When visiting the palace, talking with these people, you may get a chance to gain a first-hand stories of the Vuong family as well as what life was like there. 

The palace was transformed into a tourist site in 1993 after being acknowledged as national historic relic.
