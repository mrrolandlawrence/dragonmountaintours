# Hmong King's Palace

Located in the Sa Phin Valley is the palace of the Hmong Kings. The Hmong who origionally came from southern China many hundreds of years ago, subsequently ruled parts of northern Vietnam up until the mid 20th century. Vuong Chinh Sinh Palace, also known Vua Meo (King of the Hmong), was built in 1902 in accordance with Feng Shui rules at a cost of 50,000 peices of silver. Constucted from wood and stone, the palace is designed along the lines of a traditional Chinese house courtyard. The palace is defended by an outer stone wall to help ward off attackers.

The palace was transformed into a tourist site in 1993 after being acknowledged as national historic relic. One of the descendants of the Hmong Kings is still at the palace, but as a tour guide and not a resident.
