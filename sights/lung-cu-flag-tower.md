Lung Cu Flag Tower is Vietnam North Pole the furthermost point to the north of Vietnam, lying close to China-Vietnam border. Lung Cu is about 20km from Dong Van Town and 170km from Ha Giang City. 

The road up to Dong Van is already hard, the road up to Lung Cu Flag Tower is even harder, car or motorbike. Once you reach the flagpole’s entrance, you’ll have to climb almost 400 steps to reach the actually flagpole. Continue to climb some more steps, the views on the top will reward your effort. The flag tower was built on the top 300m high Rong Mountain which is 1600m above sea level. Two semicircular lakes at the foot of the mountain are said to be the eyes of the dragon. 

Lung Cu Flag Tower shows the affirmation of position and sovereignty of Vietnam as well as honor the patriotism and bravery of the people and soldiers in the border area. The flog on the tower has an area of 54sqm, symbolizing the unity of 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam.  

Lung Cu is a great place to take panoramic photos of Dong Van, Ha Giang, especially the winding Happiness Road below.
