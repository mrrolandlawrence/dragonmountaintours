# Lying Dragon Mountain

Constructed in 1980. The One thousand steps (500 up, 500 down) can see a little intimidating at fist, but they are conquered in about half an hour. The steps themselves are a little worn in places and take should be taken as there are few handrails to stead yourself on. The view from the top is well worth it though. On one side you can see the Ngo Dong River down below, flanked by the limestone karsts. From the top looking the other way you can see the dragon sculptures as well as a small shrine.

    Hang Mua Peak. is one of the most spectacular sites to visit around Tam Coc (5 km from the "pier"). 450 steps bring you to the tip of the peak, from which you have a most spectacular 360° view of the entire region, the Red River Delta on the East and the mountains on the other sides. Definitely a Must visit if all those steps do not scare you. Flip flops are possible but not recommended, as the steps can be rather slippery and the rocks are jagged. Parking is not included with the entry fee as of late and is 10k for scooter or 5k for bicycle; ignore the people just outside the ticket booth aggressively attempting to wave you into their paid (15k) parking lot. The only reason to go with these guys is if you want an eye kept on your bike, but keep in mind that the cheaper parking right after the entrance gate to the site is a quite safe place. 100kđ.  edit
