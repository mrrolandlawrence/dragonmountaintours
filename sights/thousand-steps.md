# Lying Dragon Mountain

Constructed in 1980. The One thousand steps (500 up, 500 down) can see a little intimidating at fist, but they are conquered in about half an hour. The steps themselves are a little worn in places and take should be taken as there are few handrails to stead yourself on. The view from the top is well worth it though. On one side you can see the Ngo Dong River down below, flanked by the limestone karsts. From the top looking the other way you can see the dragon sculptures as well as a small shrine.
