# Traditional Homestay’s

Your accommodation for the multi day tours is in a traditional style homestay though there are options to stay with a local family if you desire the ultimate immersive cultural experience. Homestay’s in Sapa tend to be more modern with better facilities, ones in Ha Giang are usually period buildings converted to homestay’s and are a little more basic. Many of the homestay’s can offer a private room if you need. Please talk to us if this is a requirement for you. Otherwise it’s communal sleeping area’s.

As for facilities, all the homestay’s have a shower & washing facilities, toilets, electricity (220v & 2 pin type socket type) as well as being the place where we usually have breakfast and supper (please let us known beforehand if you are vegan / vegetarian / pescatarian or have any allergies). Not all homestay’s have WiFi and mobile phone coverage in Ha Giang is not 100% due to its remoteness and undeveloped nature so please bare that in mind.
